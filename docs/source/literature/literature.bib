	abstract = {A theoretical model is developed to explore the high frequency wheel/rail interaction with coupling between the vertical and lateral directions. This coupling is introduced through the track dynamics due to the offset of the wheel/rail contact point from the rail centre line. Equivalent models of the railway track in the time domain are developed according to the rail vibration receptances in the frequency domain. The wheel is represented by a mass in each direction with no vertical-lateral coupling. The vertical wheel/rail interaction is generated through a non-linear Hertzian contact stiffness, allowing for the possibility of loss of contact between the wheel and rail. The lateral interaction is represented by a contact spring and a creep force damper in series and their values depend on the vertical contact force. The vibration source is the roughness on the wheel and rail contact surfaces which forms a relative displacement excitation in the vertical direction. Using the combined interaction model with this relative displacement excitation, the wheel/rail interactions with coupling between the vertical and lateral vibrations are simulated. It is found that the lateral interaction force caused by the offset is usually less than thirty percent of the vertical dynamic force. The lateral vibration of the rail is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the presence of the lateral coupling, whereas the vertical interaction is almost unaffected by the lateral force.},
