	doi = {10.3390/acoustics4040052},
	abstract = {To model the vibration and structure-borne sound excitation and propagation of a railway rail, it can be modeled as an infinite beam on an elastic foundation. Existing analytical or numerical models are either formulated in the frequency domain or consider only finite beams in the time domain. Therefore, a time-domain approach for bending wave propagation on an effectively infinite beam on an elastic foundation is proposed. The approach makes use of an implicit finite-difference method that allows for varying properties of the beam and the foundation along the length of the beam. Strategies for an efficient discretization are discussed. The method is validated against existing analytical models for a single layer and two layers, as well as continuous and discrete support. The results show very good agreement, and it can be concluded that the proposed method can be seen as a versatile method for simulating the behavior of a beam on different kinds of elastic foundations.},

	abstract = {First, some typical measured results are shown for the vibration behaviour of a railway track, in particular the point mobilities and track decay rates. Then, models of track vibration of gradually increasing complexity are introduced. These consist of an infinite beam on a foundation of damped springs and masses. Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams are introduced as well as more complex finite element models. The influence of parameters such as rail pad stiffness and damping are illustrated. Discrete supports are considered as well as an equivalent continuous one. Models for the rail pad, the ballast and the sleepers are also discussed.},

	doi = {10.1076/vesd.41.1.27.23407},
	abstract = {A theoretical model is developed to explore the high frequency wheel/rail interaction with coupling between the vertical and lateral directions. This coupling is introduced through the track dynamics due to the offset of the wheel/rail contact point from the rail centre line. Equivalent models of the railway track in the time domain are developed according to the rail vibration receptances in the frequency domain. The wheel is represented by a mass in each direction with no vertical-lateral coupling. The vertical wheel/rail interaction is generated through a non-linear Hertzian contact stiffness, allowing for the possibility of loss of contact between the wheel and rail. The lateral interaction is represented by a contact spring and a creep force damper in series and their values depend on the vertical contact force. The vibration source is the roughness on the wheel and rail contact surfaces which forms a relative displacement excitation in the vertical direction. Using the combined interaction model with this relative displacement excitation, the wheel/rail interactions with coupling between the vertical and lateral vibrations are simulated. It is found that the lateral interaction force caused by the offset is usually less than thirty percent of the vertical dynamic force. The lateral vibration of the rail is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the presence of the lateral coupling, whereas the vertical interaction is almost unaffected by the lateral force.},
