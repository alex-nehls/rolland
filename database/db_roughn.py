"""Rail roughness instances.

This module contains instances of the Roughness class representing different roughness types.

Roughness types:
    - rough_a
    - rough_b

Attributes
----------
    r_rough (list): Rail roughness spectrum [f, m].
    w_rough (list): Wheel roughness spectrum [f, m].
    c_filter (list): Contact filter spectrum [f, m].
